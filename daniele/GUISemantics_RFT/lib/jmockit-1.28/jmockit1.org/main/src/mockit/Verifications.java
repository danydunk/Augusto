/**
 * Used to <em>verify</em> a set of expectations on available {@linkplain Mocked mocked} types and/or instances,
 * against the invocations which actually occurred during the test.
 * As such, these verifications can only appear <em>after</em> having exercised the code under test.
 * <p/>
 * An expectation verification attempts to match a number of method or constructor invocations, that we expect have
 * occurred during the execution of code under test.
 * By default, <em>at least one</em> matching invocation must be found for the verification to be successful; if no
 * matching invocations are found, an assertion error is thrown.
 * <p/>
 * Expectations are verified simply by invoking the desired method or constructor on a mocked type/instance, during
 * the initialization of a {@code Verifications} object.
 * Typically, this is done by instantiating an anonymous subclass containing an instance initialization body, or as we
 * call it, a <em>verification block</em>:
 * <pre>
 * // Exercise tested code.
 * codeUnderTest.doSomething();
 *
 * // Now verify that the expected invocations actually occurred (in any order).
 * new Verifications() {{
 *    <strong>mock1</strong>.expectedMethod(anyInt);
 *    <strong>mock2</strong>.anotherExpectedMethod(1, "test"); times = 2;
 * }};
 * </pre>
 * The relative order between the invocations that match two or more verifications is not taken into consideration; when
 * that is desired, the {@link VerificationsInOrder} class should be used instead.
 * <p/>
 * Naturally, not all invocations that occurred during the execution of code under test need to be explicitly verified
 * in a verification block.
 * If desired, however, we can make sure that <em>all</em> such invocations are verified, by using the
 * {@link FullVerifications} class instead.

    * The effect of specifying a (positive) number of iterations is equivalent to setting to that number the lower and

    * Captures the argument value passed into the associated expectation parameter, for a matching invocation that
    * occurred when the tested code was exercised.
    * This method should be used in a local variable assignment expression inside a verification block.
    * For example:
    * <pre>
    * codeUnderTest.doSomething();
    *
    * new Verifications() {{
    *    String <strong>name</strong>;
    *    int <strong>age</strong>;

    *    assertTrue(<strong>age</strong> >= 18);
    * }};
    * </pre>
    * If there is more than one matching invocation, then only the last one to have occurred is considered.
    * Apart from capturing received argument values, this method has the same effect as the {@link #any} argument
    * matcher.
    * <p/>
    * When an argument matcher is used for a regular (ie, non-varargs) parameter in a call to a mocked
    * method/constructor, it's <em>not</em> necessary to also use matchers for the other parameters.
    * So, it's valid to mix the use of matchers with given values.
    * Any arguments given as literals, local variables, or fields, will be implicitly matched as if
    * {@link #withEqual(Object)} had been used.
    * In the special case of a varargs method, however, this flexibility is not available: if a matcher is used for any
    * regular parameter, or for any element in the varargs array, then a matcher <em>must</em> be used for every other
    * parameter and varargs element.
