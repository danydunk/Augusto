/**
 * Indicates a class to be tested, with optional automatic instantiation and/or automatic injection of dependencies.
 * This annotation is applicable to instance fields of a test class; alternatively, it can be used as a meta-annotation
 * on a user-defined annotation which, in turn, needs to have {@linkplain RetentionPolicy#RUNTIME runtime}
 * {@linkplain Retention retention} and be {@linkplain Target applicable} to {@linkplain ElementType#FIELD fields}.
 * <p/>
 * If the tested field is not {@code final}, then it is eligible for automatic instantiation and initialization.
 * By default, automatic creation occurs just before a test method is executed, provided the tested field remains
 * {@code null} at such time; this default can be changed by specifying the {@link #availableDuringSetup} optional
 * attribute as {@code true}.
 * Whenever automatic creation occurs, a suitable instance of the tested class is created, initialized, and assigned to
 * the field.
 * Available {@linkplain Injectable injectables} are used, either as argument values for the chosen constructor of the
 * tested class, or as values to set into injected fields of the newly-created tested object.
 * <p/>
 * For <em>constructor injection</em>, all constructor parameters (if any) must be satisfied with the values of
 * available injectables.
 * If the tested class has a constructor annotated with the standard CDI annotation "<code>@Inject</code>", then it is
 * the one to be used;
 * otherwise, if there are multiple satisfiable constructors then the one with the most parameters <em>and</em> the
 * widest accessibility (ie, first {@code public}, then {@code protected}, then <em>package-private</em>, and finally
 * {@code private}) is chosen.
 * The matching between injectable values and constructor parameters is done by <em>type</em> when there is only one
 * parameter of a given type; otherwise, by type <em>and name</em>.
 * <p/>
 * Whenever the tested object is created automatically, <em>field injection</em> is also performed.
 * Only non-<code>final</code> fields are considered, between those declared in the tested class itself or in one of its
 * super-classes; at this time constructor injection already occurred, so only fields which remain uninitialized are
 * targeted.
 * For each such <em>target</em> field, the value of a still unused injectable of the <em>same</em> type is assigned, if
 * any is available.
 * When a tested object has multiple target fields of the <em>same</em> type, not just the type but also the
 * <em>name</em> of each field will be used when looking for available injectables.
 * Finally, if there is no matching and available injectable value for a given target field, it is left unassigned,
 * unless the target field is for a <em>required</em> dependency; note that all fields marked with a DI annotation
 * (such as {@code @Inject}, {@code Autowired}, etc.) indicate required dependencies by default
 * (the use of "<code>@Autowired(required = false)</code>" is respected, if present).
 * <p/>
 * Whenever constructor or field injection is used, the value of each injectable goes into <em>at most one</em> matching
 * constructor parameter or instance field of a tested class.
 * <p/>
 * The tested class can be {@code abstract}.
 * In this case, if the tested field is left null then a subclass implementing all abstract methods is automatically
 * generated and instantiated.
 * The abstract method implementations are automatically <em>mocked</em> so that expectations can be recorded or
 * verified on them.
 * <p/>
 * When the {@link #fullyInitialized} attribute is {@code true}, all eligible fields in the tested object will get
 * initialized with a suitable instance, which itself is recursively initialized in the same way.
 *

    * Indicates that each field of the tested object that is eligible for injection should be assigned a value, which
    * can be an {@linkplain Injectable @Injectable}, another {@code @Tested} field of a type assignable to the field
    * type, or a real (unmocked) instance of the field type.
    * Non-eligible fields are those that have already being assigned from a constructor, or that have a primitive,
    * array, annotation, or JRE type (with the exception of the types described below, which are given special
    * treatment).
    * <p/>
    * For each field of a reference type that would otherwise remain {@code null}, an attempt is made to automatically
    * create and recursively initialize a suitable real instance.
    * For this attempt to succeed, the type of the field must either be a concrete class having a constructor that can
    * be satisfied by available injectables and/or by recursively created dependencies, or a known interface (see below)
    * for which a real instance can be created.
    * <p/>
    * Constructor injection is also supported.
    * In this case, the same rules used for injected fields apply to the parameters of the constructor that gets chosen
    * for automatic instantiation.
    * <p/>
    * Currently, the following standard types (some of which are Java EE interfaces) have special support:
    * <ul>
    *    <li>
    *       {@link java.util.logging.Logger}: a logger is automatically
    *       {@linkplain java.util.logging.Logger#getLogger(String) created} with the name of the tested class.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       {@link javax.sql.DataSource}: a JDBC data source is created and configured according to a matching
    *       {@link javax.annotation.sql.DataSourceDefinition @DataSourceDefinition} in the tested class.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       {@link javax.inject.Provider Provider&lt;T>}: a provider which produces an instance of type {@code T} is
    *       injected.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       JPA interfaces {@link javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory} and {@link javax.persistence.EntityManager}:
    *       created through calls to {@link javax.persistence.Persistence#createEntityManagerFactory(String)} and
    *       {@link javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory#createEntityManager()}, provided a suitable
    *       {@code META-INF/persistence.xml} file is available in the runtime classpath.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       Servlet interfaces {@link javax.servlet.ServletContext} and {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpSession}:
    *       objects that emulate the servlet context and HTTP session are automatically created for use in tests.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       {@link javax.enterprise.context.Conversation}: an object that emulates a web application's conversation
    *       context is created.
    *    </li>
    * </ul>
