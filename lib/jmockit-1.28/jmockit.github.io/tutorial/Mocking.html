<p>
   In the JMockit library, the <strong>Expectations</strong> API provides rich support for the use of <em>mocking</em>
   in automated developer tests.
   When mocking is used, a test focuses on the behavior of the code under test, as expressed through its
   <em>interactions</em> with other types it depends upon.
   Mocking is typically used in the construction of <em>isolated</em> unit tests, where a <em>unit</em> under test
   is exercised in isolation from the implementation of other units it depends on.
   Typically, a unit of behavior is embodied in a single class, but it's also fine to consider a whole set of
   strongly-related classes as a single unit for the purposes of unit testing (as is usually the case when we have a
   central public class with one or more helper classes, possibly package-private); in general, individual methods
   should not be regarded as separate units on their own.
</p>
<p>
   <em>Strict</em> unit testing, however, is not a recommended approach; one should not attempt to mock every single
   dependency.
   Mocking is best used in moderation; whenever possible, favor integration tests over isolated unit tests.
   This said, mocking is occasionally also useful in the creation of integration tests, when some particular
   dependency cannot have its real implementation easily used, or when attempting to create tests for corner cases where
   a well-placed mocked interaction can greatly facilitate the test.
</p>
<p>
   An interaction between two classes always takes the form of a method or constructor <em>invocation</em>.
   The set of invocations from a tested class to its dependencies, together with the argument and return values passed
   between them, define the behavior of interest for the tests of that particular class.
   In addition, a given test may need to verify the relative order of execution between multiple invocations.
</p>

<h2 id="mocked">
   <a href="#mocked">Mocked types and instances</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Methods and constructors invoked from the code under test on a dependency are the targets for mocking.
   Mocking provides the mechanism that we need in order to isolate the tested code from (some of) its dependencies.
   We specify which particular dependencies are to be mocked for a given test (or tests) by declaring suitable <em>mock
   fields</em> and/or <em>mock parameters</em>; mock fields are declared as annotated instance fields of the test class,
   while mock parameters are declared as annotated parameters of a test method.
   The type of the dependency to be mocked will be the type of the mock field or parameter.
   Such a type can be any kind of <em>reference</em> type: an <code>interface</code>, a <code>class</code> (including
   <code>abstract</code> and <code>final</code> ones), an annotation, or an <code>enum</code>.
</p>
<p>
   By default, <em>all</em> non-<code>private</code> methods (including any that are <code>static</code>,
   <code>final</code>, or <code>native</code>) of the mocked type will be mocked for the duration of the test.
   If the declared mocked type is a class, then all of its super-classes up to but not including
   <code class="type">java.lang.Object</code> will also be mocked, recursively.
   Therefore, inherited methods will automatically be mocked as well.
   Also in the case of a class, all of its non-<code>private</code> <em>constructors</em> will get mocked.
</p>
<p>
   When a method or constructor is mocked, its original implementation code won't be executed for invocations occurring
   during the test.
   Instead, the call will be redirected to JMockit so it can be dealt with in the manner that was explicitly or
   implicitly specified for the test.
</p>
<p>
   The following example test skeleton serves as a basic illustration for the declaration of mock fields and mock
   parameters, as well as the way in which they are typically used in test code.
   In this tutorial, we use many code snippets like this, where the parts in bold font are the current focus of
   explanation.
</p>
<pre><code>// "Dependency" is mocked for all tests in this test class.
// The "mockInstance" field holds a mocked instance automatically created for use in each test.
@Mocked <strong>Dependency mockInstance</strong>;

@Test
public void doBusinessOperationXyz(@Mocked final <strong>AnotherDependency anotherMock</strong>)
{
   ...
   new Expectations() {{ // an "expectation block"
      ...
      // Record an expectation, with a given value to be returned:
      <strong>mockInstance</strong>.mockedMethod(...); result = 123;
      ...
   }};
   ...
   // Call the code under test.
   ...
   new Verifications() {{ // a "verification block"
      // Verifies an expected invocation:
      <strong>anotherMock</strong>.save(any); times = 1;
   }};
   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   For a mock parameter declared in a test method, an instance of the declared type will be automatically created by
   JMockit and passed by the JUnit/TestNG test runner when it executes the test method;
   therefore, the parameter value will never be <code>null</code>.
   For a mock field, an instance of the declared type will be automatically created by JMockit and assigned to the
   field, provided it's not <code>final</code>.
</p>
<p>
   There are a few different annotations available for the declaration of mock fields and parameters, and ways in which
   the default mocking behavior can be modified to suit the needs of a particular test.
   Other sections of this chapter go into the details, but the basics are:
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Mocked.html">@Mocked</a> is the central mocking annotation, having one optional attribute
   which is useful in certain cases; <a href="../api1x/mockit/Injectable.html">@Injectable</a> is another
   mocking annotation, which constrains mocking to the instance methods of a single mocked instance; and
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Capturing.html">@Capturing</a> is yet another mocking annotation, which extends mocking to
   the classes implementing a mocked interface, or the subclasses extending a mocked class.
   When <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> or <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> is applied to a mock
   field or mock parameter, <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> is implied so it doesn't need to (but can) be
   applied as well.
</p>
<p>
   The mocked instances created by JMockit can be used normally in test code (for the recording and verification of
   expectations), and/or passed to the code under test. Or they may simply go unused.
   Differently from other mocking APIs, these <em>mocked</em> objects don't have to be the ones used by the code under
   test when it calls instance methods on its dependencies.
   By default (ie, when <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> is not used), JMockit does not care on which object
   a mocked instance method is called.
   This allows the transparent mocking of instances created directly inside code under test, when said code invokes
   constructors on brand new instances using the <code>new</code> operator;
   the classes instantiated must be covered by mocked types declared in test code, that's all.
</p>

<h2 id="expectation">
   <a href="#expectation">Expectations</a>
</h2>
<p>
   An <em>expectation</em> represents a set of invocations to a specific mocked method/constructor that is relevant for
   a given test.
   An expectation may cover multiple different invocations to the same method or constructor, but it doesn't have to
   cover <em>all</em> such invocations that occur during the execution of the test.
   Whether a particular invocation matches a given expectation or not will depend not only on the method/constructor
   signature but also on runtime aspects such as the instance on which the method is invoked, argument values, and/or
   the number of invocations already matched.
   Therefore, several types of matching <em>constraints</em> can (optionally) be specified for a given expectation.
</p>
<p>
   When we have one or more invocation parameters involved, an exact argument value may be specified for each parameter.
   For example, the value <code>"test string"</code> could be specified for a <code>String</code> parameter, causing the
   expectation to match only those invocations with this exact value in the corresponding parameter.
   As we will see later, instead of specifying exact argument values, we can specify more relaxed constraints which will
   match whole sets of different argument values.
</p>
<p>
   The example below shows an expectation for <code>Dependency#someMethod(int, String)</code>, which will match an
   invocation to this method with the exact argument values as specified.
   Notice that the expectation itself is specified through an isolated invocation to the mocked method.
   There are no special API methods involved, as is common in other mocking APIs.
   This invocation, however, does not count as one of the "real" invocations we are interested in testing.
   It's only there so that the expectation can be specified.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void doBusinessOperationXyz(@Mocked final Dependency mockInstance)
{
   ...
   new Expectations() {{
      ...
      // An expectation for an instance method:
      <strong>mockInstance.someMethod(1, "test");</strong> result = "mocked";
      ...
   }};

   // A call to code under test occurs here, leading to mock invocations
   // that may or may not match specified expectations.
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   We will see more about expectations later, after we understand the differences between <em>recording</em>,
   <em>replaying</em>, and <em>verifying</em> invocations.
</p>

<h2 id="model">
   <a href="#model">The <em>record-replay-verify</em> model</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Any developer test can be divided in at least three separate execution <em>phases</em>.
   The phases execute sequentially, one at a time, as demonstrated below.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void someTestMethod()
{
   // 1. Preparation: whatever is required before the code under test can be exercised.
   ...
   // 2. The code under test is exercised, usually by calling a public method.
   ...
   // 3. Verification: whatever needs to be checked to make sure the code exercised by
   //    the test did its job.
   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   First, we have a preparation phase, where objects and data items needed for the test are created or obtained from
   somewhere else.
   Then, code under test is exercised.
   Finally, the results from exercising the tested code are compared with the expected results.
</p>
<p>
   This model of three phases is also known as the <em>Arrange, Act, Assert syntax</em>, or "AAA" for short.
   Different words, but the meaning is the same.
</p>
<p>
   In the context of behavior-based testing with mocked types (and their mocked instances), we can identify the
   following alternative phases, which are directly related to the three previously described conventional testing
   phases:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      The <strong><em>record</em></strong> phase, during which invocations can be <em>recorded</em>.
      This happens during test preparation, <em>before</em> the invocations we want to test are executed.
   </li>
   <li>
      The <strong><em>replay</em></strong> phase, during which the mock invocations of interest have a chance to be
      executed, as the code under test is exercised.
      The invocations to mocked methods/constructors previously recorded will now be <em>replayed</em>.
      Often there isn't a one-to-one mapping between invocations recorded and replayed, though.
   </li>
   <li>
      The <strong><em>verify</em></strong> phase, during which invocations can be <em>verified</em> to have occurred as
      expected.
      This happens during test verification, <em>after</em> the invocations under test had a chance to be executed.
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   Behavior-based tests written with JMockit will typically fit the following templates:
</p>
<pre><code>import mockit.*;
... other imports ...

public class SomeTest
{
   // Zero or more "mock fields" common to all test methods in the class:
   @Mocked Collaborator mockCollaborator;
   @Mocked AnotherDependency anotherDependency;
   ...

   @Test
   public void testWithRecordAndReplayOnly(mock parameters)
   {
      // Preparation code not specific to JMockit, if any.

      <strong>new Expectations()</strong> {{ // an "expectation block"
         // One or more invocations to mocked types, causing expectations to be <strong>recorded</strong>.
         // Invocations to non-mocked types are also allowed anywhere inside this block
         // (though not recommended).
      }};

      // Unit under test is exercised.

      // Verification code (JUnit/TestNG assertions), if any.
   }

   @Test
   public void testWithReplayAndVerifyOnly(mock parameters)
   {
      // Preparation code not specific to JMockit, if any.

      // Unit under test is exercised.

      <strong>new Verifications()</strong> {{ // a "verification block"
         // One or more invocations to mocked types, causing expectations to be <strong>verified</strong>.
         // Invocations to non-mocked types are also allowed anywhere inside this block
         // (though not recommended).
      }};

      // Additional verification code, if any, either here or before the verification block.
   }

   @Test
   public void testWithBothRecordAndVerify(mock parameters)
   {
      // Preparation code not specific to JMockit, if any.

      <strong>new Expectations()</strong> {{
         // One or more invocations to mocked types, causing expectations to be recorded.
      }};

      // Unit under test is exercised.

      <strong>new VerificationsInOrder()</strong> {{ // an <em>ordered</em> verification block
         // One or more invocations to mocked types, causing expectations to be verified
         // in the specified order.
      }};

      // Additional verification code, if any, either here or before the verification block.
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   There are other variations to the above templates, but the essence is that the expectation blocks belong to the
   <em>record</em> phase and come before the code under test is exercised, while the verification blocks belong to the
   <em>verify</em> phase.
   A test method can contain any number of expectation blocks, including none. The same is true for verification blocks.
</p>
<p>
   The fact that anonymous inner classes are used to demarcate blocks of code allows us to take advantage of the
   "code folding" feature available in modern Java IDEs.
   The following image shows what it looks like in IntelliJ IDEA.
</p>
<img src="code-folding.png" style="border: 1px solid #888; box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #666;">

<h2 id="strictness">
   <a href="#strictness">Regular versus <em>strict</em> expectations</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Expectations recorded inside a
   "<code>new <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html">Expectations</a>() {...}</code>" block are the regular ones.
   What this means is that the invocations they specify are <em>expected</em> to occur <em>at least once</em> during the
   <em>replay</em> phase; they may occur more than once, though, and in a different order relative to other recorded
   expectations; additionally, invocations that don't match any recorded expectation are allowed to occur in any number
   and in any order.
   If no invocation matches a given recorded expectation, a "missing invocation" error gets thrown at the end of the
   test, causing it to fail (this is only the default behavior, though, as it can be overridden).
</p>
<p>
   The API also supports the concept of <em>strict</em> expectations: those that, when recorded, only allow invocations
   during replay that exactly match the recordings (within explicitly specified allowances, when needed), both in the
   number of matching invocations (<em>exactly one</em>, by default) and in the order they occur.
   Invocations that occur during replay but fail to match a recorded strict expectation are regarded as
   <em>unexpected</em>, causing an immediate "unexpected invocation" error, and consequently failing the test.
   This is achieved by using the <a href="../api1x/mockit/StrictExpectations.html">StrictExpectations</a> subclass.
</p>
<p>
   Note that in the case of strict expectations, all invocations occurring during replay that match recorded
   expectations are <em>implicitly</em> verified.
   Any remaining invocations that don't match an expectation are considered unexpected, causing the test to fail.
   The test will also fail if any recorded strict expectation is missed, ie, if no matching invocations occur during
   replay.
</p>
<p>
   We can mix expectations of different levels of strictness in the same test by writing multiple expectation blocks,
   some regular (using <code class="type">Expectations</code>), others strict (using
   <code class="type">StrictExpectations</code>).
   Normally, a given mock field or mock parameter will appear in expectation blocks of a single kind, though.
</p>
<p>
   Most tests will simply make use of "regular" expectations.
   Usage of strict expectations is probably more a matter of personal preference.
</p>

<h3 id="strictMocks">
   <a href="#strictMocks">Strict and non-strict <em>mocks</em></a>
</h3>
<p>
   Note that we do not specify that a given mocked type/instance should be <em>strict</em> or not.
   Instead, the strictness for a given mock field/parameter is determined by how it is used in the test.
   Once the first strict expectation is recorded in a "<code>new StrictExpectations() {...}</code>" block, the
   associated mocked type/instance is considered to be strict for the whole test; otherwise, it will be <em>not</em>
   strict.
</p>

<h2 id="results">
   <a href="#results">Recording results for an expectation</a>
</h2>
<p>
   For a given method with non-<code>void</code> return type, a return value can be recorded through an assignment to
   the <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#result">result</a> field.
   When the method gets called in the replay phase, the specified return value will be returned to the caller.
   The assignment to <code>result</code> should appear right after the invocation that identifies the recorded
   expectation, inside an expectation block.
</p>
<p>
   If the test instead needs an exception or error to be thrown when the method is invoked, then the <code>result</code>
   field can still be used: simply assign the desired throwable instance to it.
   Note that the recording of exceptions/errors to be thrown is applicable to mocked methods (of any return type) as
   well as to mocked constructors.
</p>
<p>
   Multiple <em>consecutive</em> results (values to return and/or throwables to throw) can be recorded for the same
   expectation, by simply assigning the <code>result</code> field multiple times in a row.
   The recording of multiple return values and/or exceptions/errors to be thrown can be freely mixed for the same
   expectation.
   In the case of recording multiple consecutive <em>return values</em> for a given expectation, a single call to the
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#returns-java.lang.Object-java.lang.Object...-">returns(Object...)</a>
   method can be made.
   Also, a single assignment to the <code>result</code> field will achieve the same effect, if the value assigned to it
   is a <em>list</em> or <em>array</em> containing the consecutive values.
</p>
<p>
   The following example test records both types of results for the methods of a mocked
   <code class="type">DependencyAbc</code> class, to be used when they are invoked from a
   <code class="type">UnitUnderTest</code> class.
   Lets say the implementation of the class under test goes like this:
</p>
<pre><code>public class UnitUnderTest
{
(1)private final DependencyAbc abc = <strong>new DependencyAbc()</strong>;

   public void doSomething()
   {
(2)   int n = <strong>abc.intReturningMethod()</strong>;

      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         String s;

         try {
(3)         s = <strong>abc.stringReturningMethod()</strong>;
         }
         catch (SomeCheckedException e) {
            // somehow handle the exception
         }

         // do some other stuff
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   A possible test for the <code>doSomething()</code> method could exercise the case where
   <code class="type">SomeCheckedException</code> gets thrown, after an arbitrary number of successful iterations.
   Assuming that we want (for whatever reasons) to record a <em>complete</em> set of expectations for the interaction
   between these two classes, we might write the test below.
   (Often, it's not desirable or important to specify <em>all</em> invocations to mocked methods and - specially -
   mocked constructors in a given test. We will address this issue later.)
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void doSomethingHandlesSomeCheckedException(@Mocked final DependencyAbc abc) throws Exception
{
   new Expectations() {{
(1)   <strong>new DependencyAbc()</strong>;

(2)   abc.intReturningMethod(); <strong>result = 3</strong>;

(3)   abc.stringReturningMethod();
      <strong>returns("str1", "str2")</strong>;
      <strong>result = new SomeCheckedException()</strong>;
   }};

   new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   This test records three different expectations.
   The first one, represented by the call to the <code>DependencyAbc()</code> constructor, merely accounts for the fact
   that this dependency happens to be instantiated in the code under test through the no-args constructor; no result
   needs to be specified for such an invocation, except for the occasional exception/error to be thrown (constructors
   have <code>void</code> return type, so it makes no sense to record return values for them).
   The second expectation specifies that <code>intReturningMethod()</code> will return <code>3</code> when called.
   The third one specifies a sequence of three consecutive results for <code>stringReturningMethod()</code>, where the
   last result happens to be an instance of the desired exception, allowing the test to achieve its goal (note that it
   will only pass if the exception is not propagated out).
</p>

<h2 id="instanceMatching">
   <a href="#instanceMatching">Matching invocations to specific instances</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Previously, we explained that an expectation recorded on a mocked instance, such as
   "<code><strong>abc</strong>.someMethod();</code>" would actually match invocations to
   <code>DependencyAbc#someMethod()</code> on <em>any</em> instance of the mocked
   <code class="type">DependencyAbc</code> class.
   In most cases, tested code uses a <em>single</em> instance of a given dependency, so this won't really matter and can
   be safely ignored, whether the mocked instance is <em>passed into</em> the code under test or <em>created inside</em>
   it.
   But what if we need to verify that invocations occur on a <em>specific</em> instance, between several ones that
   happen to be used in the code under test?
   Also, what if only one or a few instances of the mocked class should actually be mocked, with other instances of the
   same class remaining unmocked?
   (This second case tends to occur more often when classes from the standard Java libraries, or from other third-party
   libraries, are mocked.)
   The API provides a mocking annotation, <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, which will only mock <em>one</em>
   instance of the mocked type, leaving others unaffected.
   Additionally, we have a couple ways to constrain the matching of expectations to specific
   <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> instances, while still mocking <em>all</em> instances of the mocked class.
</p>

<h3 id="injectable">
   <a href="#injectable">Injectable mocked instances</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Suppose we need to test code which works with multiple instances of a given class, some of which we want to mock.
   If an instance to be mocked can be <em>passed</em> or <em>injected</em> into the code under test, then we can declare
   an <a href="../api1x/mockit/Injectable.html">@Injectable</a> mock field or mock parameter for it.
   This <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> instance will be an "exclusive" mocked instance;
   any other instance of the same mocked type, unless obtained from a separate mock field/parameter, will remain as a
   regular, non-mocked instance.
</p>
<p>
   When using <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, <code>static</code> methods and constructors are also
   excluded from being mocked.
   After all, a <code>static</code> method is not associated with any instance of the class, while a constructor is
   only associated with a newly created (and therefore different) instance.
</p>
<p>
   For an example, lets say we have the following class to be tested.
</p>
<pre><code>public final class ConcatenatingInputStream extends InputStream
{
   private final Queue&lt;InputStream> sequentialInputs;
   private InputStream currentInput;

   public ConcatenatingInputStream(InputStream... sequentialInputs)
   {
      this.sequentialInputs = new LinkedList&lt;InputStream>(Arrays.asList(sequentialInputs));
      currentInput = this.sequentialInputs.poll();
   }

   @Override
   public int read() throws IOException
   {
      if (currentInput == null) return -1;

      int nextByte = currentInput.read();

      if (nextByte >= 0) {
         return nextByte;
      }

      currentInput = sequentialInputs.poll();
      return read();
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   This class could easily be tested without mocking by using <code class="type">ByteArrayInputStream</code> objects for
   input, but lets say we want to make sure that the <code>InputStream#read()</code> method is properly invoked on each
   input stream passed in the constructor.
   The following test will achieve this.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void concatenateInputStreams(
   @Injectable final InputStream input1, @Injectable final InputStream input2)
   throws Exception
{
   new Expectations() {{
      input1.read(); returns(1, 2, -1);
      input2.read(); returns(3, -1);
   }};

   InputStream concatenatedInput = new ConcatenatingInputStream(input1, input2);
   byte[] buf = new byte[3];
   concatenatedInput.read(buf);

   assertArrayEquals(new byte[] {1, 2, 3}, buf);
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that the use of <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> is indeed necessary here, since the class under test
   extends the mocked class, and the method called to exercise <code class="type">ConcatenatingInputStream</code> is
   actually defined in the base <code class="type">InputStream</code> class.
   If <code class="type">InputStream</code> was mocked "normally", the <code>read(byte[])</code> method would always be
   mocked, regardless of the instance on which it is called.
</p>

<h3 id="onInstance">
   <a href="#onInstance">The <code>onInstance(m)</code> constraint</a>
</h3>
<p>
   When using <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> or <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> (and not
   <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> on the same mock field/parameter), we can still match replay invocations
   to expectations recorded on specific mocked instances.
   For that, we use the
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#onInstance-java.lang.Object-">onInstance(mockObject)</a> method when
   recording the expectation, as the next example shows.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void matchOnMockInstance(@Mocked final Collaborator <strong>mock</strong>)
{
   new Expectations() {{
      <strong>onInstance(mock)</strong>.getValue(); result = 12;
   }};

   // Exercise code under test with mocked instance passed from the test:
   int result = <strong>mock</strong>.getValue();
   assertEquals(12, result);

   // If another instance is created inside code under test...
   Collaborator another = new Collaborator();

   // ...we won't get the recorded result, but the default one:
   assertEquals(0, another.getValue());
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The test above will only pass if the tested code (here embedded in the test method itself, for brevity) invokes
   <code>getValue()</code> on the exact same instance on which the recording invocation was made.
   This is typically useful when the code under test makes calls on two or more different instances of the same type,
   and the test wants to verify that each invocation occurred on the proper instance.
</p>
<p>
   To avoid the need to use <code>onInstance(m)</code> on every expectation when testing code which uses multiple
   instances of the same type in different ways, JMockit automatically infers the need for "onInstance" matching based
   on the set of mocked types in scope.
   Specifically, whenever two or more mock fields/parameters of the exact same type are in scope for a given test,
   invocations to instance methods made on their instances will always match expectations recorded on those same
   instances.
   Therefore, in such common situations it isn't necessary to explicitly use the <code>onInstance(m)</code> method.
</p>

<h3 id="futureInstancesByConstructor">
   <a href="#futureInstancesByConstructor">Instances created with a given constructor</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Specifically for <em>future</em> instances that will later get created by code under test, JMockit provides a couple
   mechanisms through which we can match invocations on them.
   Both mechanisms require the recording of an expectation on a specific <em>constructor invocation</em> (a
   "<code>new</code>" expression) of the mocked class.
</p>
<p>
   The first mechanism involves simply using the new instance obtained from the recorded constructor expectation, when
   recording expectations on instance methods.
   Lets see an example.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void newCollaboratorsWithDifferentBehaviors(@Mocked Collaborator anyCollaborator)
{
   // Record different behaviors for each set of instances:
   new Expectations() {{
      // One set, instances created with "a value":
      Collaborator col1 = new Collaborator("a value");
      col1.doSomething(anyInt); result = 123;

      // Another set, instances created with "another value":
      Collaborator col2 = new Collaborator("another value");
      col2.doSomething(anyInt); result = new InvalidStateException();
   }};

   // Code under test:
   new Collaborator("a value").doSomething(5); // will return 123
   ...
   new Collaborator("another value").doSomething(0); // will throw the exception
   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the above test, we declare a single mock field or mock parameter of the desired class, using
   <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>.
   This mock field/parameter, however, is <em>not</em> used when recording expectations; instead, we use the instances
   created on <em>instantiation recordings</em> to record further expectations on instance methods.
   The future instances created with matching constructor invocations will map to those recorded instances.
   Also, note that it's not necessarily a one-to-one mapping, but a many-to-one mapping, from potentially many future
   instances to a single instance used for recorded expectations.
</p>
<p>
   The second mechanism lets us record a <em>replacement instance</em> for those future instances that match a recorded
   constructor invocation.
   With this alternative mechanism, we can rewrite the test as follows.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void newCollaboratorsWithDifferentBehaviors(
   @Mocked final Collaborator col1, @Mocked final Collaborator col2)
{
   new Expectations() {{
      // Map separate sets of future instances to separate mock parameters:
      new Collaborator("a value"); result = col1;
      new Collaborator("another value"); result = col2;

      // Record different behaviors for each set of instances:
      col1.doSomething(anyInt); result = 123;
      col2.doSomething(anyInt); result = new InvalidStateException();
   }};

   // Code under test:
   new Collaborator("a value").doSomething(5); // will return 123
   ...
   new Collaborator("another value").doSomething(0); // will throw the exception
   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Both versions of the test are equivalent.
   The second one also allows, when combined with <em>partial</em> mocking, for real (non-mocked) instances to be used
   as replacements.
</p>

<h2 id="argumentMatching">
   <a href="#argumentMatching">Flexible matching of argument values</a>
</h2>
<p>
   In both the <em>record</em> and <em>verify</em> phases, an invocation to a mocked method or constructor identifies an
   expectation.
   If the method/constructor has one or more parameters, then a recorded/verified expectation like
   <code>doSomething(1, "s", true);</code> will only match an invocation in the <em>replay</em> phase if it has
   <em>equal</em> argument values.
   For arguments that are regular objects (not primitives or arrays), the <code>equals(Object)</code> method is used for
   equality checking.
   For parameters of array type, equality checking extends to individual elements; therefore, two different array
   instances having the same length in each dimension and equal corresponding elements are considered equal.
</p>
<p>
   In a given test, we often don't know exactly what those argument values will be, or they simply aren't essential for
   what is being tested.
   So, to allow a recorded or verified invocation to match a whole set of replayed invocations with different argument
   values, we can specify flexible <em>argument matching constraints</em> instead of actual argument values.
   This is done by using <code>anyXyz</code> <em>fields</em> and/or <code>withXyz(...)</code> methods.
   The "any" fields and "with" methods are all defined in <code class="type">mockit.Invocations</code>, which is the
   base class for all the expectation/verification classes used in tests;
   therefore, they can be used in expectation as well as verification blocks.
</p>

<h3 id="matcherFields">
   <a href="#matcherFields">Using the "any" fields for argument matching</a>
</h3>
<p>
   The most common argument matching constraint tends also to be the <em>least</em> restrictive one: to match
   invocations with <em>any</em> value for a given parameter (of the proper parameter type, of course).
   For such cases we have a whole set of special <em>argument matching fields</em>, one for each primitive type (and the
   corresponding wrapper class), one for strings, and a "universal" one of type <code>Object</code>.
   The test below demonstrates some uses.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void someTestMethod(@Mocked final DependencyAbc abc)
{
   final DataItem item = new DataItem(...);

   new Expectations() {{
      // Will match "voidMethod(String, List)" invocations where the first argument is
      // any string and the second any list.
      abc.voidMethod(<strong>anyString, (List&lt;?>) any</strong>);
   }};

   new UnitUnderTest().doSomething(item);

   new Verifications() {{
      // Matches invocations to the specified method with any value of type long or Long.
      abc.anotherVoidMethod(<strong>anyLong</strong>);
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Uses of "<code>any</code>" fields must appear at the actual argument positions in the invocation statement, never
   before.
   You can still have regular argument values for other parameters in the same invocation, though.
   For more details, see the <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#anyInt">API documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="withMethods">
   <a href="#withMethods">Using the "with" methods for argument matching</a>
</h3>
<p>
   When recording or verifying an expectation, calls to the <code>withXyz(...)</code> methods can occur for any subset
   of the arguments passed in the invocation.
   They can be freely mixed with regular argument-passing (using literal values, local variables, etc.).
   The only requirement is that such calls appear inside the recorded/verified invocation statement, rather than before
   it.
   It's not possible, for example, to first assign the result of a call to <code>withNotEqual(val)</code> to a local
   variable and then use the variable in the invocation statement.
   An example test using some of the "with" methods is shown below.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void someTestMethod(@Mocked final DependencyAbc abc)
{
   final DataItem item = new DataItem(...);

   new Expectations() {{
      // Will match "voidMethod(String, List)" invocations with the first argument
      // equal to "str" and the second not null.
      abc.voidMethod(<strong>"str", (List&lt;?>) withNotNull()</strong>);

      // Will match invocations to DependencyAbc#stringReturningMethod(DataItem, String)
      // with the first argument pointing to "item" and the second one containing "xyz".
      abc.stringReturningMethod(<strong>withSameInstance(item), withSubstring("xyz")</strong>);
   }};

   new UnitUnderTest().doSomething(item);

   new Verifications() {{
      // Matches invocations to the specified method with any long-valued argument.
      abc.anotherVoidMethod(<strong>withAny(1L)</strong>);
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   There are more "with" methods than shown above.
   See the <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#withEqual-T-">API documentation</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
   Besides the several predefined argument matching constraints available in the API, JMockit allows the user to provide
   custom constraints, through the <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#with-mockit.Delegate-">with(Delegate)</a>
   and <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#withArgThat-org.hamcrest.Matcher-">withArgThat(Matcher)</a> methods.
</p>

<h3 id="nullAsMatcher">
   <a href="#nullAsMatcher">Using the <code>null</code> value to match any object reference</a>
</h3>
<p>
   When using at least one argument matching method or field for a given expectation, we can use a "shortcut" to specify
   that any object reference should be accepted (for a parameter of reference type).
   Simply pass the <code>null</code> value instead of a <code>withAny(x)</code> or <code>any</code> argument matcher.
   In particular, this avoids the need to cast the value to the declared parameter type.
   However, bear in mind that this behavior is only applicable when <em>at least one</em> explicit argument matcher
   (either a "with" method or an "any" field) is used for the expectation.
   When passed in an invocation that uses no matchers, the <code>null</code> value will match only the <code>null</code>
   reference.
   In the previous test, we could therefore have written:
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void someTestMethod(@Mocked final DependencyAbc abc)
{
   ...
   new Expectations() {{
      abc.voidMethod(anyString, <strong>null</strong>);
   }};
   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   To specifically verify that a given parameter receives the <code>null</code> reference, the
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#withNull--">withNull()</a> matcher can be used.
</p>

<h3 id="varargs">
   <a href="#varargs">Matching values passed through a <em>varargs</em> parameter</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Occasionally we may need to deal with expectations for "varargs" methods or constructors.
   It's valid to pass regular values as a varargs argument, and <em>also</em> valid to use the "with"/"any" matchers
   for such values.
   However, it's <em>not</em> valid to combine both kinds of value-passing for the same expectation, when there is a
   varargs parameter.
   We need to either use <em>only</em> regular values or <em>only</em> values obtained through argument matchers.
</p>
<p>
   In case we want to match invocations where the varargs parameter receives any number of values (including zero),
   we can specify an expectation with the "<strong><code>(Object[]) any</code></strong>" constraint for the final
   varargs parameter.
</p>

<h2 id="constraints">
   <a href="#constraints">Specifying invocation count constraints</a>
</h2>
<p>
   So far, we saw that besides an associated method or constructor, an expectation can have invocation results and
   argument matchers.
   Given that code under test can call the same method or constructor multiple times with different or identical
   arguments, we sometimes need a way to account for all those separate invocations.
</p>
<p>
   The number of invocations expected and/or allowed to match a given expectation can be specified through
   <em>invocation count constraints</em>.
   The mocking API provides three special fields just for that:
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#times">times</a>,
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#minTimes">minTimes</a>, and
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#maxTimes">maxTimes</a>.
   These fields can be used either when recording or when verifying expectations.
   In either case, the method or constructor associated with the expectation will be constrained to receive a number of
   invocations that falls in the specified range.
   Any invocations less or more than the expected lower or upper limit, respectively, and the test
   execution will automatically fail.
   Lets see some example tests.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void someTestMethod(@Mocked final DependencyAbc abc)
{
   new Expectations() {{
      // By default, at least one invocation is expected, i.e. "minTimes = 1":
      new DependencyAbc();

      // At least two invocations are expected:
      abc.voidMethod(); <strong>minTimes = 2;</strong>

      // 1 to 5 invocations are expected:
      abc.stringReturningMethod(); <strong>minTimes = 1; maxTimes = 5;</strong>
   }};

   new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();
}

@Test
public void someOtherTestMethod(@Mocked final DependencyAbc abc)
{
   new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();

   new Verifications() {{
      // Verifies that zero or one invocations occurred, with the specified argument value:
      abc.anotherVoidMethod(3); <strong>maxTimes = 1;</strong>

      // Verifies the occurrence of at least one invocation with the specified arguments:
      DependencyAbc.someStaticMethod("test", false); // "minTimes = 1" is implied
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Unlike the <code>result</code> field, each of these three fields can be specified at most once for a given
   expectation.
   Any non-negative integer value is valid for any of the invocation count constraints.
   If <code><em>times</em> = <strong>0</strong></code> or <code><em>maxTimes</em> = <strong>0</strong></code> is
   specified, the first invocation matching the expectation to occur during replay (if any) will cause the test to fail.
</p>

<h2 id="verification">
   <a href="#verification">Explicit verification</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Besides specifying invocation count constraints on recorded expectations, we can also verify matching invocations
   explicitly in a <em>verification</em> block, <em>after</em> the call to the code under test.
   This is valid for regular expectations, but not for strict expectations, since they are always verified
   <em>implicitly</em>; there is no point in re-verifying them in a explicit verification block.
</p>
<p>
   Inside a "<code>new <a href="../api1x/mockit/Verifications.html">Verifications</a>() {...}</code>" block we can use
   the same API that's available in a "<code>new Expectations() {...}</code>" block, with the exception of methods and
   fields used to record return values and thrown exceptions/errors.
   That is, we can freely use the <code>anyXyz</code> fields, the <code>withXyz(...)</code> argument matching methods,
   and the <code>times</code>, <code>minTimes</code>, and <code>maxTimes</code> invocation count constraint fields.
   An example test follows.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void verifyInvocationsExplicitlyAtEndOfTest(@Mocked final Dependency mock)
{
   // Nothing recorded here, though it could be.

   // Inside tested code:
   Dependency dependency = new Dependency();
   dependency.doSomething(123, true, "abc-xyz");

   // Verifies that Dependency#doSomething(int, boolean, String) was called at least once,
   // with arguments that obey the specified constraints:
   <strong>new Verifications() {{ mock.doSomething(anyInt, true, withPrefix("abc")); }};</strong>
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that, by default, a verification checks that <em>at least one</em> matching invocation occurred during replay.
   When we need to verify an exact number of invocations (including <code>1</code>), the <code>times = n</code>
   constraint must be specified.
</p>

<h3 id="neverHappened">
   <a href="#neverHappened">Verifying that an invocation never happened</a>
</h3>
<p>
   To do this inside a verification block, add a "<code>times = 0</code>" assignment right after the
   invocation that is expected to not have happened during the replay phase.
   If one or more matching invocations did happen, the test will fail.
</p>

<h3 id="verificationInOrder">
   <a href="#verificationInOrder">Verification in order</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Regular verification blocks created with the <code class="type">Verifications</code> class are <em>unordered</em>.
   The actual relative order in which <code>aMethod()</code> and <code>anotherMethod()</code> were called during the
   replay phase is not verified, but only that each method was executed at least once.
   If you want to verify the relative order of invocations, then a
   "<code>new <a href="../api1x/mockit/VerificationsInOrder.html">VerificationsInOrder</a>() {...}</code>" block must be
   used instead.
   Inside this block, simply write invocations to one or more mocked types in the order they are expected to have
   occurred.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void verifyingExpectationsInOrder(@Mocked final DependencyAbc abc)
{
   // Somewhere inside the tested code:
   abc.aMethod();
   abc.doSomething("blah", 123);
   abc.anotherMethod(5);
   ...

   new <strong>VerificationsInOrder</strong>() {{
      // The order of these invocations must be the same as the order
      // of occurrence during replay of the matching invocations.
      <strong>abc.aMethod();
      abc.anotherMethod(anyInt);</strong>
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that the call <code>abc.doSomething(...)</code> was <em>not</em> verified in the test, so it could have occurred
   at any time (or not at all).
</p>

<h3 id="partiallyOrdered">
   <a href="#partiallyOrdered">Partially ordered verification</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Suppose you want to verify that a particular method (or constructor) was called <em>before</em>/<em>after</em> other
   invocations, but you don't care about the order in which those other invocations occurred.
   Inside an ordered verification block, this can be achieved by simply calling the
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/VerificationsInOrder.html#unverifiedInvocations--">unverifiedInvocations()</a>
   method at the appropriate place(s).
   The following test demonstrates it.
</p>
<pre><code>@Mocked DependencyAbc abc;
@Mocked AnotherDependency xyz;

@Test
public void verifyingTheOrderOfSomeExpectationsRelativeToAllOthers()
{
   new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();

   new VerificationsInOrder() {{
      abc.methodThatNeedsToExecuteFirst();
      <strong>unverifiedInvocations();</strong> // Invocations not verified must come here...
      xyz.method1();
      abc.method2();
      <strong>unverifiedInvocations();</strong> // ... and/or here.
      xyz.methodThatNeedsToExecuteLast();
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The example above is actually quite sophisticated, as it verifies several things:
   a) a method that must be called <em>before</em> others; b) a method that must be called <em>after</em> others;
   and c) that <code>AnotherDependency#method1()</code> must be called just before <code>DependencyAbc#method2()</code>.
   In most tests, we will probably only do one of these different kinds of order-related verifications.
   But the power is there to make all kinds of complex verifications quite easily.
</p>
<p>
   Another situation not covered by the examples above is one where we want to verify that certain invocations occurred
   in a given relative order, while also verifying the other invocations (in any order).
   For this, we need to write two separate verification blocks, as illustrated below (where <code>mock</code> is a mock
   field of the test class).
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void verifyFirstAndLastCallsWithOthersInBetweenInAnyOrder()
{
   // Invocations that occur while exercising the code under test:
   mock.prepare();
   mock.setSomethingElse("anotherValue");
   mock.setSomething(123);
   mock.notifyBeforeSave();
   mock.save();

   new VerificationsInOrder() {{
      mock.prepare(); // first expected call
      <strong>unverifiedInvocations();</strong> // others at this point
      mock.notifyBeforeSave(); // just before last
      mock.save(); times = 1; // last expected call
   }};

   // Unordered verification of the invocations previously left unverified.
   // Could be ordered, but then it would be simpler to just include these invocations
   // in the previous block, at the place where "unverifiedInvocations()" is called.
   new Verifications() {{
      mock.setSomething(123);
      mock.setSomethingElse(anyString);
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Usually, when a test has multiple verification blocks their relative order of execution <em>is</em> important.
   In the previous test, for example, if the unordered block came before it would have left no "unverified invocations"
   to match a later call to <code>unverifiedInvocations()</code>;
   the test would still pass (assuming it originally passed) since it's not required that unverified invocations
   actually occurred at the called position, but it would <em>not</em> have verified that the unordered group of
   invocations occurred between the first and last expected calls.
</p>

<h3 id="fullVerification">
   <a href="#fullVerification">Full verification</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Sometimes it may be important to have <em>all</em> invocations to the mocked types involved in a test verified.
   This is automatically the case when recording strict expectations, since any unexpected invocation causes the test to
   fail.
   When regular expectations are explicitly verified, though, a
   "<code>new <a href="../api1x/mockit/FullVerifications.html">FullVerifications</a>() {...}</code>" block can be used
   to make sure that no invocations are left unverified.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void verifyAllInvocations(@Mocked final Dependency mock)
{
   // Code under test included here for easy reference:
   mock.setSomething(123);
   mock.setSomethingElse("anotherValue");
   mock.setSomething(45);
   mock.save();

   <strong>new FullVerifications()</strong> {{
      // Verifications here are unordered, so the following invocations could be in any order.
      mock.setSomething(anyInt); // verifies two actual invocations
      mock.setSomethingElse(anyString);
      mock.save(); // if this verification (or any other above) is removed the test will fail
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that if a lower limit (a minimum invocation count constraint) is specified for an expectation, then this
   constraint will always be implicitly verified at the end of the test.
   Therefore, explicitly verifying such an expectation inside the full verification block is not necessary.
</p>

<h3 id="fullVerificationInOrder">
   <a href="#fullVerificationInOrder">Full verification in order</a>
</h3>
<p>
   So, we have seen how to do <em>unordered</em> verifications with <code class="type">Verifications</code>,
   <em>ordered</em> verifications with <code class="type">VerificationsInOrder</code>, and full verifications with
   <code class="type">FullVerifications</code>.
   But what about <em>full ordered</em> verifications? Easy enough:
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void verifyAllInvocationsInOrder(@Mocked final Dependency mock)
{
   // Code under test included here for easy reference:
   mock.setSomething(123);
   mock.setSomethingElse("anotherValue");
   mock.setSomething(45);
   mock.save();

   <strong>new FullVerificationsInOrder()</strong> {{
      mock.setSomething(anyInt);
      mock.setSomethingElse(anyString);
      mock.setSomething(anyInt);
      mock.save();
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Notice there is a not so obvious difference in semantics, though.
   In the <code>verifyAllInvocations</code> test above, we were able to match two separate
   <code>mock.setSomething(...)</code> invocations with a single invocation in the verification block.
   In the <code>verifyAllInvocationsInOrder</code> test, however, we had to write two separate invocations to that
   method inside the block, in the proper order with respect to other invocations.
</p>

<h3 id="restrictedFullVerifications">
   <a href="#restrictedFullVerifications">Restricting the set of mocked types to be fully verified</a>
</h3>
<p>
   By default, <em>all</em> invocations to <em>all</em> mocked instances/types in effect for a given test must be
   verified explicitly when using a "<code>new FullVerifications() {}</code>" or
   "<code>new FullVerificationsInOrder() {}</code>" block.
   Now, what if we have a test with two (or more) mocked types but we only want to fully verify invocations to one of
   them (or to any subset of mocked types when more than two)?
   The answer is to use the
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/FullVerifications.html#FullVerifications-java.lang.Object...-">
      FullVerifications(mockedTypesAndInstancesToVerify)</a> constructor, where only the given mocked instances and
   mocked types (ie, class objects/literals) are considered.
   The following test provides an example.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void verifyAllInvocationsToOnlyOneOfTwoMockedTypes(
   @Mocked final Dependency mock1, @Mocked AnotherDependency mock2)
{
   // Inside code under test:
   mock1.prepare();
   mock1.setSomething(123);
   <strong>mock2</strong>.doSomething();
   mock1.editABunchMoreStuff();
   mock1.save();

   new <strong>FullVerifications(mock1)</strong> {{
      mock1.prepare();
      mock1.setSomething(anyInt);
      mock1.editABunchMoreStuff();
      mock1.save(); times = 1;
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the test above, the <code>mock2.doSomething()</code> invocation is never verified.
</P>
<p>
   To restrict verification only to the methods/constructors of a single mocked class, pass the class literal to the
   <code>FullVerifications(...)</code> or <code>FullVerificationsInOrder(...)</code> constructor.
   For example, the <code>new FullVerificationsInOrder(AnotherDependency.class) { ... }</code> block would only make
   sure that all invocations to the mocked <code class="type">AnotherDependency</code> class were verified.
</p>

<h3 id="emptyFullVerifications">
   <a href="#emptyFullVerifications">Verifying that no invocations occurred</a>
</h3>
<p>
   To verify that <em>no</em> invocations at all occurred on the mocked types/instances used in a test, add an
   <em>empty</em> full verification block to it.
   As always, note that any expectations that were <em>recorded</em> as expected through a specified
   <code>times/minTimes</code> constraint are verified implicitly and therefore disregarded by the full verification
   block; in such a case the empty verification block will verify that no <em>other</em> invocations occurred.
   Additionally, if any expectations were verified in a <em>previous</em> verification block in the same test, they are
   also disregarded by the full verification block.
</p>
<p>
   If the test uses two or more mocked types/instances and you want to verify that no invocations occurred for some of
   them, specify the desired mocked types and/or instances in the constructor to the empty verification block.
   An example test follows.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void verifyNoInvocationsOnOneOfTwoMockedDependenciesBeyondThoseRecordedAsExpected(
   @Mocked final Dependency mock1, @Mocked final AnotherDependency mock2)
{
   new Expectations() {{
      // These two are recorded as expected:
      mock1.setSomething(anyInt);
      mock2.doSomething(); times = 1;
   }};

   // Inside code under test:
   mock1.prepare();
   mock1.setSomething(1);
   mock1.setSomething(2);
   mock1.save();
   mock2.doSomething();

   // Will verify that no invocations other than to "doSomething()" occurred on mock2:
   <strong>new FullVerifications(mock2) {};</strong>
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="unspecifiedInvocations">
   <a href="#unspecifiedInvocations">Verifying unspecified invocations that should not happen</a>
</h3>
<p>
   A full verification block (ordered or not) also allows us to verify that certain methods and/or constructors never
   get invoked, without having to record or verify each one of them with a corresponding <code><em>times</em> = 0</code>
   assignment.
   The following test provides an example.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void readOnlyOperation(@Mocked final Dependency mock)
{
   new Expectations() {{
      mock.getData(); result = "test data";
   }};

   // Code under test:
   String data = mock.getData();
   // <strong>mock.save() should not be called here</strong>
   ...

   <strong>new FullVerifications()</strong> {{
      mock.getData(); <strong>minTimes = 0; // calls to getData() are allowed, others are not</strong>
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   If a call to any method (or constructor) of the <code class="type">Dependency</code> class occurs during the replay
   phase, except for the ones explicitly verified in the verification block (<code>Dependency#getData()</code> in this
   case), then the test above will fail.
   On the other hand, it may be easier to use strict expectations in such cases, without any verification block at all.
</p>

<h2 id="withCapture">
   <a href="#withCapture">Capturing invocation arguments for verification</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Invocation arguments can be captured for later verification through a set of special "<code>withCapture(...)</code>"
   methods.
   There are three different cases, each with its own specific capturing method:
   1) verification of arguments passed to a mocked method, in a single invocation: <code>T withCapture()</code>;
   2) verification of arguments passed to a mocked method, in multiple invocations:
   <code>T withCapture(List&lt;T>)</code>; and
   3) verification of arguments passed to a mocked constructor: <code>List&lt;T> withCapture(T)</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="singleInvocationCapture">
   <a href="#singleInvocationCapture">Capturing arguments from a single invocation</a>
</h3>
<p>
   To capture arguments from a single invocation to a mocked method or constructor, we use "<code>withCapture()</code>",
   as the following example test demonstrates.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void capturingArgumentsFromSingleInvocation(@Mocked final Collaborator mock)
{
   // Inside tested code:
   new Collaborator().doSomething(0.5, new int[2], "test");

   new Verifications() {{
      double d;
      String s;
      mock.doSomething(<strong>d = withCapture()</strong>, null, <strong>s = withCapture()</strong>);

      assertTrue(d > 0.0);
      assertTrue(s.length() > 1);
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The <a href="../api1x/mockit/Verifications.html#withCapture--">withCapture()</a> method can only be used in
   verification blocks.
   Typically, we use it when a <em>single</em> matching invocation is expected to occur; if more than one such
   invocation occurs, however, the last one to occur overwrites the values captured by previous ones.
   It is particularly useful with parameters of a complex type (think a JPA <code class="annotation">@Entity</code>),
   which may contain several items whose values need to be checked.
</p>

<h3 id="multipleInvocationCapture">
   <a href="#multipleInvocationCapture">Capturing arguments from multiple invocations</a>
</h3>
<p>
   If <em>multiple</em> invocations to a mocked method or constructor are expected, and we want to capture values for
   all of them, then the <a href="../api1x/mockit/Verifications.html#withCapture-java.util.List-">withCapture(List)</a>
   method should be used instead, as in the example below.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void capturingArgumentsFromMultipleInvocations(@Mocked final Collaborator mock)
{
   mock.doSomething(dataObject1);
   mock.doSomething(dataObject2);

   new Verifications() {{
      List&lt;DataObject> dataObjects = new ArrayList<>();
      mock.doSomething(<strong>withCapture(dataObjects)</strong>);

      assertEquals(2, dataObjects.size());
      DataObject data1 = dataObjects.get(0);
      DataObject data2 = dataObjects.get(1);
      // Perform arbitrary assertions on data1 and data2.
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Differently from <code>withCapture()</code>, the <code>withCapture(List)</code> overload can also be used in
   expectation recording blocks.
</p>

<h3 id="capturingNewInstances">
   <a href="#capturingNewInstances">Capturing new instances</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Finally, we can capture the new instances of a mocked class that got created during the test.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void capturingNewInstances(@Mocked Person mockedPerson)
{
   // From the code under test:
   dao.create(new Person("Paul", 10));
   dao.create(new Person("Mary", 15));
   dao.create(new Person("Joe", 20));

   new Verifications() {{
      // Captures the new instances created with a specific constructor.
      List&lt;Person> personsInstantiated = withCapture(new Person(anyString, anyInt));

      // Now captures the instances of the same type passed to a method.
      List&lt;Person> personsCreated = new ArrayList<>();
      dao.create(withCapture(personsCreated));

      // Finally, verifies both lists are the same.
      assertEquals(personsInstantiated, personsCreated);
   }};
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="delegates">
   <a href="#delegates">Delegates: specifying custom results</a>
</h2>
<p>
   We have seen how to record results for invocations through assignments to the <code><em>result</em></code> field or
   calls to the <code>returns(...)</code> method.
   We have also seen how to match invocation arguments flexibly with the <code>withXyz(...)</code> group of methods and
   the various <code>anyXyz</code> fields.
   But what if a test needs to decide the result of a recorded invocation based on the arguments it will receive at
   replay time?
   We can do it through a <a href="../api1x/mockit/Delegate.html">Delegate</a> instance, as exemplified below.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void delegatingInvocationsToACustomDelegate(@Mocked final DependencyAbc anyAbc)
{
   new Expectations() {{
      anyAbc.intReturningMethod(anyInt, null);
      result = <strong>new Delegate() {
         int aDelegateMethod(int i, String s)
         {
            return i == 1 ? i : s.length();
         }
      }</strong>;
   }};

   // Calls to "intReturningMethod(int, String)" will execute the delegate method above.
   new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The <code class="type">Delegate</code> interface is empty, being used simply to tell JMockit that actual invocations
   at replay time should be delegated to the "delegate" method in the assigned object.
   This method can have any name, provided it is the only non-<code>private</code> method in the delegate object.
   As for the parameters of the delegate method, they should either match the parameters of the recorded method, or
   there should be none.
   In any case, the delegate method is allowed to have an additional parameter of type
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Invocation.html">Invocation</a> as its first parameter.
   (The <code class="type">Invocation</code> object received during replay will provide access to the invoked instance
   and the actual invocation arguments, along with other abilities.)
   The return type of a delegate method doesn't have to be the same as the recorded method, although it should be
   compatible in order to avoid a <code class="type">ClassCastException</code> later.
</p>
<p>
   Constructors can also be handled through delegate <em>methods</em>.
   The following example test shows a constructor invocation being delegated to a method which conditionally throws an
   exception.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void delegatingConstructorInvocations(@Mocked Collaborator anyCollaboratorInstance)
{
   new Expectations() {{
      new Collaborator(anyInt);
      result = <strong>new Delegate() {
         void delegate(int i) { if (i < 1) throw new IllegalArgumentException(); }
      }</strong>;
   }};

   // The first instantiation using "Collaborator(int)" will execute the delegate above.
   new Collaborator(4);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="cascading">
   <a href="#cascading">Cascading mocks</a>
</h2>
<p>
   When using complex APIs where functionality is distributed through many different objects, it is not uncommon to see
   chained invocations of the form <code>obj1.getObj2(...).getYetAnotherObj().doSomething(...)</code>.
   In such cases it may be necessary to mock all objects/classes in the chain, starting with <code>obj1</code>.
</p>
<p>
   All three mocking annotations provide this ability.
   The following test shows a basic example, using the <code>java.net</code> and <code>java.nio</code> APIs.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void recordAndVerifyExpectationsOnCascadedMocks(
   @Mocked Socket anySocket, // will match any new Socket object created during the test
   @Mocked final SocketChannel cascadedChannel // will match cascaded instances
) throws Exception
{
   new Expectations() {{
      // Calls to Socket#getChannel() will automatically return a cascaded SocketChannel;
      // such an instance will be the same as the second mock parameter, allowing us to
      // use it for expectations that will match all cascaded channel instances:
      cascadedChannel.isConnected(); result = false;
   }};

   // Inside production code:
   Socket sk = new Socket(); // mocked as "anySocket"
   SocketChannel ch = sk.getChannel(); // mocked as "cascadedChannel"

   if (!ch.isConnected()) {
      SocketAddress sa = new InetSocketAddress("remoteHost", 123);
      ch.connect(sa);
   }

   InetAddress adr1 = sk.getInetAddress();  // returns a newly created InetAddress instance
   InetAddress adr2 = sk.getLocalAddress(); // returns another new instance
   ...

   // Back in test code:
   new Verifications() {{ cascadedChannel.connect((SocketAddress) withNotNull()); }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the test above, calls to eligible methods in the mocked <code class="type">Socket</code> class will return a
   <em>cascaded mock</em> object whenever they occur during the test.
   The cascaded mock will allow further cascading, so a <code>null</code> reference will never be obtained from methods
   which return object references (except for non-eligible return types <code>Object</code> or <code>String</code> which
   will return <code>null</code>, or collection types which will return a non-mocked empty collection).
</p>
<p>
   Unless there is an available mocked instance from a mock field/parameter (such as
   <code>cascadedChannel</code> above), a <em>new</em> cascaded instance will get created from the first call to each
   mocked method.
   In the example above, the two different methods with the same <code>InetAddress</code> return type will create and
   return <em>different</em> cascaded instances; the same method will always return the same cascaded instance, though.
</p>
<p>
   New cascaded instances are created with <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> semantics, so as to not affect
   other instances of the same type that may exist during the test.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, it's worth noting that, if necessary, cascaded instances can be replaced with non-mocked ones, with a
   different mocked instance, or not be returned at all; for that, record an expectation which assigns the
   <code>result</code> field with the desired instance to be returned, or with <code>null</code> if no such instance
   is desired.
</p>

<h3 id="staticFactories">
   <a href="#staticFactories">Cascading static factory methods</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Cascading is extremely useful in scenarios where a mocked class contains <code>static</code> <em>factory
   methods</em>.
   In the following example test, lets say we want to mock the <code>javax.faces.context.FacesContext</code> class from
   JSF (Java EE).
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void postErrorMessageToUIForInvalidInputFields(@Mocked final FacesContext jsf)
{
   // Set up invalid inputs, somehow.

   // Code under test which validates input fields from a JSF page, adding
   // error messages to the JSF context in case of validation failures.
   FacesContext ctx = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();

   if (<em>some input is invalid</em>) {
      ctx.addMessage(null, new FacesMessage("Input xyz is invalid: blah blah..."));
   }
   ...

   // Test code: verify appropriate error message was added to context.
   new Verifications() {{
      FacesMessage msg;
      jsf.addMessage(null, msg = withCapture());
      assertTrue(msg.getSummary().contains("blah blah"));
   }};
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   What's interesting in the test above is that we never have to worry about
   <code>FacesContext.getCurrentInstance()</code>, as the "<code>jsf</code>" mocked instance gets automatically
   returned.
</p>

<h3 id="fluent">
   <a href="#fluent">Cascading self-returning methods</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Another scenario where cascading tends to help is when code under test uses a
   "<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">fluent interface</a>", where a "builder" object returns
   itself from most of its methods.
   So, we end up with a method call chain which produces some final object or state.
   In the example test below we mock the <code>java.lang.ProcessBuilder</code> class.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void createOSProcessToCopyTempFiles(@Mocked final ProcessBuilder pb) throws Exception
{
   // Code under test creates a new process to execute an OS-specific command.
   String cmdLine = "copy /Y *.txt D:\\TEMP";
   File wrkDir = new File("C:\\TEMP");
   Process copy = new ProcessBuilder().command(cmdLine).directory(wrkDir).inheritIO().start();
   int exit = copy.waitFor();
   ...

   // Verify the desired process was created with the correct command.
   new Verifications() {{ pb.command(withSubstring("copy")).start(); }};
}
</code></pre>
<P>
   Above, methods <code>command(...)</code>, <code>directory(...)</code>, and <code>inheritIO()</code> configure the
   process to be created, while <code>start()</code> finally creates it.
   The mocked process builder object automatically returns itself ("<code>pb</code>") from these calls, while also
   returning a new mocked <code>Process</code> from the call to <code>start()</code>.
</P>

<h2 id="partial">
   <a href="#partial">Partial mocking</a>
</h2>
<p>
   By default, <em>all</em> methods and constructors which can be called on a mocked type <em>and</em> its super-types
   (except for <code class="annotation">java.lang.Object</code>) get mocked.
   This is appropriate for most tests, but in some situations we might need to <em>select</em> only certain methods or
   constructors to be mocked.
   Methods/constructors not mocked in an otherwise mocked type will execute normally when called.
</p>
<p>
   When a class or object is partially mocked, JMockit decides whether to execute the real implementation of a method or
   constructor as it gets called from the code under test, based on which expectations were recorded and which were not.
   The following example tests will demonstrate it.
</p>
<pre><code>public class PartialMockingTest

   static class Collaborator
   {
      final int value;

      Collaborator() { value = -1; }

      int getValue() { return value; }
      final boolean simpleOperation(int a, String b, Date c) { return true; }
      static void doSomething(boolean b, String s) { throw new IllegalStateException(); }
   }

   {
      final Collaborator anyInstance = new Collaborator();

      new Expectations(<strong>Collaborator.class</strong>) {{
         anyInstance.getValue(); result = 123;
      }};

      // Not mocked, as no constructor expectations were recorded:
      Collaborator c1 = new Collaborator();
      Collaborator c2 = new Collaborator(150);

      // Mocked, as a matching method expectation was recorded:
      assertEquals(123, c1.getValue());
      assertEquals(123, c2.getValue());

      // Not mocked:
      assertTrue(c1.simpleOperation(1, "b", null));
      assertEquals(45, new Collaborator(45).value);
   }

   @Test
   public void partiallyMockingASingleInstance()
   {
      final Collaborator collaborator = new Collaborator(2);

      new Expectations(<strong>collaborator</strong>) {{
         collaborator.getValue(); result = 123;
         collaborator.simpleOperation(1, "", null); result = false;

         // Static methods can be dynamically mocked too.
         Collaborator.doSomething(anyBoolean, "test");
      }};

      // Mocked:
      assertEquals(123, collaborator.getValue());
      assertFalse(collaborator.simpleOperation(1, "", null));
      Collaborator.doSomething(true, "test");

      // Not mocked:
      assertEquals(2, collaborator.value);
      assertEquals(45, new Collaborator(45).getValue());
      assertEquals(-1, new Collaborator().getValue());
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   As shown above, the
   <a href="../api1x/mockit/Expectations.html#Expectations-java.lang.Object...-">Expectations(Object...)</a> constructor
   accepts one or more classes or objects to be partially mocked.
   If a <code>Class</code> object is given, all methods <em>and</em> constructors defined in that class can be mocked,
   as well as the methods and constructors of its super-classes; <em>all</em> instances of the specified class will be
   regarded as mocked instances.
   If, on the other hand, a regular <em>instance</em> is given, then <em>only</em> methods, not constructors, in the
   class hierarchy can be mocked; even more, only <em>that</em> particular instance will be mocked.
</p>
<p>
   Notice that in these two example tests there is no mock field or mock parameter.
   The partial mocking constructor effectively provides yet another way to specify mocked types.
   It also lets us turn objects stored in <em>local variables</em> into mocked instances.
   Such objects can be created with any amount of state in internal instance fields; they will keep that state when
   mocked.
</p>
<p>
   It should be noted that, when we request a class or instance to be partially mocked, it can also have invocations
   <em>verified</em> on it, even if the verified methods/constructors were not recorded.
   For example, consider the following test.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void partiallyMockingAnObjectJustForVerifications()
   {
      final Collaborator collaborator = new Collaborator(123);

      new Expectations(collaborator) {};

      // No expectations were recorded, so nothing will be mocked.
      int value = collaborator.getValue(); // value == 123
      collaborator.simpleOperation(45, "testing", new Date());
      ...

      // Unmocked methods can still be verified:
      new Verifications() {{ c1.simpleOperation(anyInt, anyString, (Date) any); }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Finally, a simpler way to apply partial mocking to a tested class is to have a field in the test class annotated as
   both <code class="annotation">@Tested</code> (see <a href="#tested">section below</a>) and
   <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>.
   In this case, the tested object is not passed to the <code class="type">Expectations</code> constructor, but we still
   need to record expectations on any methods requiring mocked results.
</p>

<h2 id="capturing">
   <a href="#capturing">Capturing implementation classes and instances</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Our discussion of this feature will be based on the (contrived) code below.
</p>
<pre><code>public interface Service { int doSomething(); }
final class ServiceImpl implements Service { public int doSomething() { return 1; } }

public final class TestedUnit
{
   private final Service service1 = <strong>new ServiceImpl();</strong>
   private final Service service2 = <strong>new Service() { public int doSomething() { return 2; } };</strong>

   public int businessOperation()
   {
      return service1.doSomething() + service2.doSomething();
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The method we want to test, <code>businessOperation()</code>, uses classes that implement a separate interface,
   <code class="type">Service</code>.
   One of these implementations is defined through an anonymous inner class, which is completely inaccessible (except
   for the use of Reflection) from client code.
</p>

<h3 id="mockingUnspecifiedImplementations">
   <a href="#mockingUnspecifiedImplementations">Mocking unspecified implementation classes</a>
</h3>
<p>
   Given a base type (be it an <code>interface</code>, an <code>abstract</code> class, or any sort of base class), we
   can write a test which only knows about the base type but where all implementing/extending implementation classes get
   mocked.
   To do so, we declare a "capturing" mocked type which refers only to the known base type.
   Not only will implementation classes already loaded by the JVM get mocked, but also any additional classes that
   happen to get loaded by the JVM during later test execution.
   This ability is activated by the <a href="../api1x/mockit/Capturing.html">@Capturing</a> annotation, which can be
   applied to mock fields and mock parameters, as demonstrated below.
</p>
<pre><code>public final class UnitTest
{
   <strong>@Capturing Service anyService</strong>;

   @Test
   public void mockingImplementationClassesFromAGivenBaseType()
   {
      new Expectations() {{ anyService.doSomething(); returns(3, 4); }};

      int result = new TestedUnit().businessOperation();

      assertEquals(7, result);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the test above, two return values are specified for the <code>Service#doSomething()</code> method.
   This expectation will match all invocations to this method, regardless of the actual instance on which the invocation
   occurs, <em>and</em> regardless of the actual class implementing the method.
</p>

<h3 id="futureInstances">
   <a href="#futureInstances">Specifying behavior for <em>future</em> instances</a>
</h3>
<p>
   An additional ability related to capturing applies to <em>future</em> instances assignable to the mocked type, and
   is activated through the "<code>maxInstances</code>" optional attribute.
   This attribute takes an <code>int</code> value specifying the <em>maximum</em> number of future instances of the
   mocked type that should be covered by the associated mock field/parameter; when not specified, <em>all</em>
   assignable instances, both pre-existing and to be created during the test, are covered.
</p>
<p>
   The expectations recorded and/or verified on a given capturing mock field or parameter will match invocations to any
   of the future instances covered by the mock field/parameter.
   This allows us to record and/or verify different behavior for each set of future instances; for that, we declare two
   or more capturing mock fields/parameters of the same declared type, each with its own <code>maxInstances</code>
   value (except perhaps for the last mock field/parameter, which would then cover the remaining future instances).
</p>
<p>
   For the sake of demonstration, the following example test takes control of <code class="type">java.nio.Buffer</code>
   subclasses and their future instances; in a real test it would be preferable to use real buffers rather than mocked
   ones.
</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void testWithDifferentBehaviorForFirstNewInstanceAndRemainingNewInstances(
   @Capturing(maxInstances = 1) final Buffer firstNewBuffer,
   @Capturing final Buffer remainingNewBuffers)
{
   new Expectations() {{
      firstNewBuffer.position(); result = 10;
      remainingNewBuffers.position(); result = 20;
   }};

   // Code under test creates several buffers...
   ByteBuffer buffer1 = ByteBuffer.allocate(100);
   IntBuffer  buffer2 = IntBuffer.wrap(new int[] {1, 2, 3});
   CharBuffer buffer3 = CharBuffer.wrap("                ");

   // ... and eventually read their positions, getting 10 for
   // the first buffer created, and 20 for the remaining ones.
   assertEquals(10, buffer1.position());
   assertEquals(20, buffer2.position());
   assertEquals(20, buffer3.position());
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   It should be noted that while a capturing mocked type is in scope, <em>all</em> implementation classes will get
   mocked, regardless of any "<code>maxInstances</code>" limits that may have been specified.
</p>

<h2 id="tested">
   <a href="#tested">Instantiation and injection of tested classes</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Typically, a test class will exercise a single <em>tested class</em>.
   JMockit can help by automatically instantiating this class, and optionally injecting the relevant mocked
   dependencies.
   This is what the <a href="../api1x/mockit/Tested.html">@Tested</a> annotation is for.
</p>
<p>
   A non-<code>final</code> instance field annotated as such in the test class will be considered for automatic
   instantiation and injection, just before the execution of a test method.
   If at this time the field still holds the <code>null</code> reference, an instance will be created using a suitable
   constructor of the tested class, while making sure its internal dependencies get properly injected (when applicable).
   If the field has already been initialized (not <code>null</code>), then nothing will be done.
</p>
<p>
   For injection to be performed, the test class must also contain one or more mock fields or mock parameters declared
   to be <strong><code class="annotation">@Injectable</code></strong>.
   Mock fields/parameters annotated only with <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> or
   <code class="annotation">@Capturing</code> are <em>not</em> considered for injection.
   On the other hand, not all injectable fields/parameters need to have <em>mockable</em> types; they can also have
   <em>primitive</em> or <em>array</em> types.
   The following example test class will demonstrate.
</p>
<pre><code>public class SomeTest
{
   @Tested CodeUnderTest tested;
   @Injectable Dependency dep1;
   @Injectable AnotherDependency dep2;
   @Injectable int someIntegralProperty = 123;

   @Test
   public void someTestMethod(@Injectable("true") boolean flag, @Injectable("Mary") String name)
   {
      // Record expectations on mocked types, if needed.

      tested.exerciseCodeUnderTest();

      // Verify expectations on mocked types, if required.
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that a non-mockable injectable field/parameter must have a value explicitly specified to it, otherwise the
   default value would be used.
   In the case of an injectable <em>field</em>, the value can simply be assigned to the field.
   Alternatively, it can be provided in the "<code>value</code>" attribute of
   <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, which is the only way to specify the value in the case of an injectable
   test method parameter.
</p>
<p>
   Two forms of injection are supported: <em>constructor</em> injection and <em>field</em> injection.
   In the first case, the tested class must have a constructor which can be satisfied by the injectables made available
   in the test class.
   Note that for a given test, the set of available injectables consists of the set of injectable fields declared as
   instances fields of the test class <em>plus</em> the set of injectable parameters declared in the test method;
   therefore, different tests in the same test class can provide different sets of injectables for the same tested
   class.
</p>
<p>
   Once the tested class is initialized with the chosen constructor, its non-<code>final</code> instance fields are
   considered for injection.
   For each such field to be injected, an injectable field of the same type is searched in the test class.
   If only one is found, its current value is read and then stored in the injected field.
   If there is more than one, the injected field name is used to select between the injectable fields of same type.
