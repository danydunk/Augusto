 * Indicates a mock field or a mock parameter for which all classes extending/implementing the
 * {@linkplain Mocked mocked} type will <em>also</em> get mocked.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Future</em> instances of a capturing mocked type (ie, instances created sometime later during the test) will

 * When recording or verifying expectations on the mock field/parameter, these associated instances are regarded as
 * equivalent to the original mocked instance created for the mock field/parameter.

 * The {@link #maxInstances} attribute allows an upper limit to the number of future instances to be specified.
 * If multiple capturing mock fields/parameters of the same type are declared, this attribute can be used so that each
 * distinct instance gets associated with a separate mock field/parameter.
 * In turn, this allows different expectations to be recorded and/or verified for each grouping of future instances,
 * with each expectation using a different mock field/parameter.
